# VBA-challenge

In this challenge I was tasked with using VBA and stock data from 2018 - 2020. I was able to:

- Find the yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year per stock
- Find the percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year per stock
- Total stock volume per stock
- Find the greatest % increase, greatest % decrease, and greatest total volume
- Find all of the above for each year/worksheet

This repository includes:

- Screenshots of the results of each sheet.
- A saved .bas and .vba filed of the code
- Another READ ME with my VBA code (I use my work laptop and they have disabled the ability to save in .vba)
